# LitElement TypeScript starter

This project includes a web component created elsewhere, but is primarily an 11ty project.

It was extracted from the lit starter project, by removing everything but the 11ty stuff.

## Static 11ty Site

This project includes a simple website generated with the [eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator and the templates and pages in `/docs-src`. The site is generated to `/docs` and intended to be checked in so that GitHub pages can serve the site [from `/docs` on the master branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

To enable the site go to the GitHub settings and change the GitHub Pages &quot;Source&quot; setting to &quot;master branch /docs folder&quot;.</p>

To build the site, run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

To serve the site locally, run:

```bash
npm run docs:serve
```

The site will usually be served at http://localhost:8000.
